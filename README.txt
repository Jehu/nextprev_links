Next Prev Links
---------------
You can use the HTML attributes rel="next" and rel="prev" to indicate the
relationship between individual URLs. Using these attributes is a strong hint
to Google that you want us to treat these pages as a logical sequence[1].

This module allows you to introduce rel="next" and rel="prev" by selecting a
new pager in your views.

Currently, this module only introduces an alternative to the
views_plugin_pager_full pager but we can add an alternative to others if
wanted.

Next steps
----------
* Add support for pagers not introduced by views
* Add support for the book module
* Add support for other modules
